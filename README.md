## About Juno Cassandra
Juno Cassandra, or JCass, is a software framework for Infrastructure Deterioration modelling (IDM). JCass combines the speed of the .NET framework and the C# computer language to create a framework in which you can develop, run and analyse infrastructure deterioration models of any complexity. You can find documentation for the Juno Cassandra Framework [at this site](https://lonrix-limited.github.io/jcass_docs2).

## About Juno Cassandra Toolbox
JCass Toolbox is a lightweight desktop implementation of Juno Cassandra intended for Beta-testers and expert modellers who prefer to work in a desktop environment. JCass Toolbox is a ‘no-frills’ version of Juno Cassandra that allows low level access to your model inputs and outputs, giving you full control over the modelling process.

**Please note** that JCass Toolbox is not intended for nor suitable for enterprise level corporate settings. For these environments, Lonrix will provide a secure, browser based implementation hosted in the highly secure and centralised JunoViewer Asset Management System environment.
